# Credit_Risk_Analysis

**Overview of the analysis:**

The purpose of this analysis is to apply machine learning to solve a real-world challenge: credit card risk.

This project consists of three technical analysis deliverables to predict credit risk listed below:

Deliverable 1: Resampling Models
Deliverable 2: The SMOTEENN Algorithm
Deliverable 3: Ensemble Classifiers

**Results:**

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

**Summary:**

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
